//Immutibality:
//Pros:
//  1.Predictability
//  2.Faster Change Detection
//  3.Concurrency




//Cons:
//  1.Performance
//  2.Memory overheaded.

//immutiability means, if we created an object we can change it . we can take the copy of the object first and change that copy.
//const we cannot reassign new value of the same object. Const doesnot make the object immutable.

//In redux we cannot mutate data.
